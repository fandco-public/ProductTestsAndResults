For Outlook Web (Outlook.com)

Exporting to an ```.ics``` file directly from the Outlook web application (Outlook.com or Office 365) isn't straightforward as the feature might be limited compared to the desktop versions. You might be able to share your calendar and then save it as an ```.ics``` file:

    1. Open Outlook Web: Go to Outlook.com or your Office 365 Outlook web app and log in.
    2. Navigate to Calendar: Switch to the calendar view by selecting the calendar icon.
    3. Share Calendar:
        1. Find the "Share" option or right-click on your calendar in the sidebar and select "Sharing and permissions."
        2. You can share your calendar with your own email address to get a link that allows you to download the ```.ics``` file.

Please note that the steps can vary slightly depending on the version of Outlook you're using and the updates Microsoft may have made to the application. Always ensure you're working within the privacy guidelines and permissions if you plan to share or distribute your calendar.
